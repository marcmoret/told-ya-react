        This project is built with React for a dynamic and responsive front-end,
        powered by a .NET backend for robust API and business logic, and supported
        by MongoDB for scalable and flexible data storage. Together, these
        technologies provide a modern, full-stack application that is fast,
        reliable, and designed to grow with user needs.
